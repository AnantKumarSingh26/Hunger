        <p class="fs-5">
            The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a global initiative by the United Nations aimed at addressing poverty, inequality, climate change, and food security.
            Launched in 2015, these 17 goals serve as a roadmap for creating a sustainable and equitable world for future generations. The SDGs are interconnected, meaning progress in one goal often supports progress in others.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5">
            The goals are designed to tackle the most pressing global challenges, including environmental degradation, economic inequality, and social injustice. By 2030, the UN aims to achieve these goals through collective action by governments, businesses, and individuals.
